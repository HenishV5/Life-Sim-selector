STEP 2: Select Problem Statement

- Option 1: Select a problem statement out of few generated based on profile
- Option 2: Give specific problem statement or tools you want to master and select one problem

---
##
STEP 3: Simulation Generation

- Create certain NPCs based on profile and their level with specific skill set.
- Base Story will form

---
##
STEP 4: Simulation Starts

- Message or mail will come to user explaining first stage
- Mails will come as user progress.
- 2 Meeting of 1 hour will be set per week where NPCs will discuss everything with user as required.
- Coding will be done on user's choice IDE with Test Cases and limited sumbmissions allowed.
- When that issue is solved the next thing in the story will be given and maybe multiple tasks.
- Evaluation will be done based on multiple things like communication, In between words, wait period, confidence. Talks as well.
